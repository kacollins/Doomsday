# Doomsday
LINQPad program example using the Doomsday algorithm

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doomsday_rule

DayOfWeek is a property of DateTime, so this program is not intended to be used to calculate the day of the week.  The goals are to make the algorithm easier to memorize, and to provide an example of how to use LINQPad for debugging.

To run the program:
* Download LINQPad at http://www.linqpad.net/Download.aspx
* Press F5 or the play button. The first result will be for today's date.
* Continue entering dates. If the input is not a valid date, the program will end, so you can press enter to quit.
